# TwitterToElasticsearch
Little Python code for loading some tweets into Elasticsearch.

You will have to go create an Twitter application here : https://apps.twitter.com/
And that will give you your consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token and access_token_secret values.

You can change the filter value by editing the api_endpoint url, more informations here : https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/reference/post/statuses/filter
